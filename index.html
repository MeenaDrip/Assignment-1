    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
       My name is Amina Usman with the ID number ALT/SOE/023/2539. I was born 
    and raised in Kaduna State, Nigeria. I am currently pursuing my diploma in ALTSchool studying FrontEnd Engineering.
     It all started when i turned 14, i was given a laptop to study for school. So i surfed through the computer and 
    I landed on a webpage[Jamb.Portal.com], my curiousity peaked beacuse i was fascinated on the design on the page and how it worked. So
    I started my research and came across Html, Css which were the building blocks of a webpage and i was hooked. 
    So 5 years later, i decided to join a tech School to improve my skills and achieve my goal of becoming a 
    The Most Sorted Out FrontEnd Engineer in Nigeria and here i am in Altschool Africa following my passion.

    <h2>Reasons for joining AltSchool:</h2>
    <p>
        Well, my brother introduced me to AltSchool Africa because he did his diploma here on Progam Management
        and stated it was the best online platform in Nigeria to study Software Engineering because of the following reasons below: <br>
      1. Gaining the skills and knowledge to succeed in the tech industry. <br>
       2. Gaining the credentials and certifications that are necessary for success in the tech industry. <br>
       3. AltSchool offers an environment that encourages adaptability and continuous learning. <br>
       And after spending two months here i can see why he recommended Altschool, This institution attract students from diverse backgrounds, fostering a collaborative environment where 
        individuals from various cultures and disciplines come together.This diversity enriches learning 
        experiences and encourages a range of perspectives. <br>
       Overall, joining Altschool aligns perfectly with my aspirations for a comprehensive education that 
        not only equips me with technical expertise but also fosters innovation, prepares me for the demands 
        of the tech industry, and sets the stage for a fulfilling career path in Software Engineering.

    <p>One of my primary goals for joining AltSchool is to acquire knowledge and skills that will enable me to thrive in a rapidly changing technological landscape.
